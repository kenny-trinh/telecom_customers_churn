# A Multi-Model Machine Learning Approach

## Executive Summary

This analysis employs multiple machine learning approaches to understand customer behavior and predict churn in the telecommunications sector. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of customer information, we provide actionable insights for improving customer retention and service optimization.

## Business Context: The Story of "TeleConnect"

Meet **TeleConnect**, a mid-sized telecommunications company striving to maintain its foothold in a fiercely competitive market. Over the past year, the company has faced growing challenges: increased customer churn, stagnant revenue growth, and difficulty in predicting which services drive customer satisfaction and retention.

### The Challenge

TeleConnect's problems are multifaceted:

-   **High Churn Rates**: Nearly 20% of their customer base leaves each year, especially those on month-to-month contracts.
-   **Price Sensitivity**: Customers complain about high monthly charges, but TeleConnect lacks clarity on whether price adjustments would help.
-   **Service Bundling**: While TeleConnect offers multiple services—Internet, Streaming, Security—adoption patterns remain unclear. Are these services increasing customer value, or are they simply an added cost?

TeleConnect’s leadership knows the stakes: acquiring a new customer costs significantly more than retaining an existing one. Yet, without data-driven insights, their current retention strategies feel like guesswork.

**Why Machine Learning?**

To address these challenges, TeleConnect has embraced a multi-model machine learning approach, leveraging advanced analytics to transform their operations. By applying complementary models tailored to different aspects of customer behavior, TeleConnect seeks to:

1.  **Predict Monthly Charges**: Understand the drivers of customer spending to design smarter pricing strategies and optimize service bundles.
2.  **Analyze Customer Tenure**: Uncover patterns in contract types, payment methods, and service adoption that influence the length of customer relationships.
3.  **Forecast Churn**: Identify at-risk customers proactively and implement targeted retention efforts.
4.  **Segment Customers by Risk**: Group customers into risk categories to prioritize retention strategies effectively.

**The Opportunity**

By integrating machine learning models into its decision-making processes, TeleConnect can:

-   **Reduce churn** by predicting at-risk customers and proactively addressing their concerns.
-   **Maximize revenue** through optimized pricing and smarter service bundling.
-   **Improve retention** by understanding what drives tenure and customer satisfaction.

```

-   **Churn Distribution**:
    -   Majority of customers (1,869) did not churn, indicating an imbalanced dataset.
-   **Number of Services**:
    -   Customers with 2-3 or 8-9 services are more likely to churn, while 6-7 services correlate with better retention.
-   **Tenure**:
    -   Churners have shorter tenures, with churn risk highest in the early months.
-   **Contract Type**:
    -   Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn, while two-year contracts significantly reduce churn.
-   **Monthly Charges**:
    -   Higher monthly charges are linked to churn, particularly in the early months of tenure

# Methodology and Model Selection

Our analysis employs six complementary machine learning approaches, each chosen for specific analytical capabilities:

Our analysis employs a comprehensive suite of models, each chosen for specific analytical capabilities:

In our analysis, we employed the following machine learning approaches:

1.  **Linear Model (LM)**: To predict monthly charges and understand service impacts
2.  **GLM-Poisson**: To analyze customer tenure patterns and retention factors
3.  **GLM-Binomial**: To predict customer churn probability
4.  **Generalized Additive Model (GAM)**: To capture non-linear relationships in customer behavior
5.  **Neural Network (NN)**: To recognize complex patterns in customer churn
6.  **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: To segment customers based on churn risk and grouping them.

# Linear Model (LM) (Sabin)

To address **TeleConnect’s price sensitivity challenge**, we began by building a **Linear Model (LM)** to analyze the factors influencing **MonthlyCharges**, the amount customers pay per month. Understanding what drives these charges provides crucial insights into how TeleConnect can design competitive pricing strategies and service bundles.

The response variable for this linear model is:

-   **MonthlyCharges**: The amount customers pay per month(continuous)

The predictors used are:

1.  **Contract:** Type of contract( Month to Month, one year, two year)
2.  **InternetService**: Type of internet service (DSL, Fiber optic, No internet service).
3.  **StreamingTV**: Whether customers have streaming TV services (Yes/No).
4.  **PhoneService**: Whether customers have a phone service (Yes/No).
5.  **MultipleLines**: Whether customers have multiple phone lines (Yes/No).

Linear Model to predict monthly charges:

```{r LM-Model, echo=FALSE, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Initial linear model with all relevant predictors
lm_initial <- lm(log(MonthlyCharges) ~ 
                   tenure + 
                   InternetService + 
                   Contract + 
                   StreamingTV + 
                   StreamingMovies +
                   OnlineSecurity +
                   OnlineBackup +
                   DeviceProtection +
                   TechSupport +
                   PhoneService,
                 data = d.cleaned_telecom_customer_churn)

# Get model summary
summary(lm_initial)
```

**Coefficient Interpretation**:

-   InternetService has the largest impact:
    -   Fiber optic: +0.347 ($\approx$ 41.5% increase in charges)
    -   No service: -0.863 ($\approx$ 57.8% decrease in charges)
-   Contract Two year: +0.0882($\approx$ 9.2%) significant effect
-   PhoneService: +0.439 ($\approx$ 55.1% increase)
-   Streaming services both have similar effects (about 15%)
-   Extremely low p-value (\< 2.2e-16), indicating the model is significant

## Visualizing the main effects

**Monthly Charges against Tenure:**

```{r LM-Visualizations, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Effect of Internet Service with smoother
ggplot(d.cleaned_telecom_customer_churn, 
       aes(x = tenure, y = log(MonthlyCharges), color = InternetService)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Log Monthly Charges vs Tenure by Internet Service",
       x = "Tenure (months)",
       y = "Log Monthly Charges")
```

-   Fiber optic shows a steeper increase with tenure
-   DSL shows a moderate increase
-   No internet service stays flat

**Monthly Charges vs Tenure:**

```{r LM-Visualizations2, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Effect of Contract with smoother
ggplot(d.cleaned_telecom_customer_churn, 
       aes(x = tenure, y = log(MonthlyCharges), color = Contract)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Log Monthly Charges vs Tenure by Contract",
       x = "Tenure (months)",
       y = "Log Monthly Charges")
```

## Enhancing the models with interactions:

```{r LM-Interactions, echo=FALSE, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Enhanced model with interactions
lm_enhanced <- lm(log(MonthlyCharges) ~ 
                    tenure * InternetService +    # Add interaction with tenure
                    tenure * Contract +           # Add interaction with contract
                    StreamingTV + StreamingMovies + 
                    OnlineSecurity + OnlineBackup + 
                    DeviceProtection + TechSupport + 
                    PhoneService,
                  data = d.cleaned_telecom_customer_churn)

summary(lm_enhanced)
```

## Model Summary

Our model explains 98.82% of the variability in monthly charges, showing strong predictive power. The key factors affecting monthly charges are:

-   **Internet Service Type**:
    -   Fiber optic: +41.7%
    -   No internet: -57.2%
-   **Contract Type**:
    -   One-year: +1.1%
    -   Two-year: +3.8%
-   **Additional Services**:
    -   Streaming (TV or Movies): +15.3% each
    -   Phone Service: +15.1%
    -   Security/Support services: +7.5% each

## Model Comparison

Initial Model: R-squared = 0.9865 Enhanced Model: R-squared = 0.9882 Improvement: 0.0017 (only about 0.17%)

This small improvement suggests that:

1.  The simpler model (without interactions) might be preferable due to:
    -   Easier interpretation
    -   Greater parsimony (fewer parameters)
    -   Nearly identical predictive power (98.65% vs 98.82%)

## Business Value and Insights for Teleconnet

1.  **Internet Service is the Primary Revenue Driver**:
    -   **Value**: Internet service type (e.g., Fiber optic) has the largest impact on monthly charges, making it the most critical factor for revenue growth.
2.  **Contract Type Has Limited Revenue Impact**:
    -   **Value**: Customers pay similar monthly charges regardless of contract type.
3.  **Add-On Services Boost Revenue Incrementally**:
    -   **Value**: Services like Streaming, Security, and Tech Support add 6-14% to monthly charges, providing consistent opportunities for revenue growth.

# GLM-Poisson Model (Sabin)

To address **TeleConnect’s challenge of understanding customer retention**, we utilized a **GLM-Poisson model** to analyze the factors influencing **tenure**—the number of months a customer remains with the company. By identifying the key drivers of tenure, this model helps TeleConnect develop targeted retention strategies.

The response variable for Poisson regression must be **count data** (non-negative integers).

**Tenure** (count of months as a customer).

Include relevant predictors, such as:

-   `Contract`: Longer contracts may correlate with higher tenure.
-   `InternetService`: Different internet services might drive customer loyalty.
-   `PaymentMethod`: Certain payment methods might affect tenure (e.g., automatic payments may reduce churn).
-   `StreamingTV` and `StreamingMovies`: Value-added services could contribute to customer retention.
-   `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents`: Demographics that might influence tenure.

Exploring the Data:

```{r Poisson-DataExploration, echo=FALSE, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(d.cleaned_telecom_customer_churn, aes(x = tenure)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Tenure",
       x = "Tenure (Months)",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

-   There’s a high frequency of customers with **tenure close to 0 months**.
-   There’s another peak at **tenure near 72 months**, likely customers who have been with the company long-term.

## Fit Poisson regression

```{r Poisson-Model, echo=FALSE, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
glm_tenure <- glm(tenure ~ InternetService + Contract + PaymentMethod +
                    StreamingTV + StreamingMovies + SeniorCitizen +
                    Partner + MonthlyCharges + TotalCharges,
                  family = poisson(link = "log"), data = d.cleaned_telecom_customer_churn)

summary(glm_tenure)
```

## Key Findings

1.  **Contract Type**:
    -   Customers with a **One-year contract** are expected to have a tenure **31.5% longer** than those with a month-to-month contract.
    -   Customers with a **Two-year contract** have a **31.7% longer tenure**, making contract type a key predictor of retention.
2.  **Internet Service**:
    -   **Fiber optic users** have a slightly **higher tenure rate (+2.9%)** compared to DSL users.
    -   Customers with **No internet service** show a significant **decrease in tenure (-4.7%)**, suggesting bundled services may improve retention.
3.  **Payment Method**:
    -   Customers paying via **Mailed check** have significantly **shorter tenures (-27%)** compared to electronic payment users.
    -   **Credit card automatic payments** also show slightly shorter tenure (-20%), indicating that payment methods might influence retention.
4.  **Streaming Services**:
    -   **Streaming services (TV and Movies)** do not appear to significantly impact tenure, suggesting these features may not drive long-term customer retention.
5.  **Senior Citizen**:
    -   **Senior citizens** have a **7.4% longer tenure** than non-senior citizens, showing their loyalty to services.
6.  **Monthly and Total Charges**:
    -   **Monthly Charges** negatively impact tenure, with higher monthly charges leading to shorter tenures.
    -   **Total Charges** positively influence tenure, as expected for long-term customers.

## Evaluating the model:

**1. Goodness of Fit:**

-   **Residual Deviance**:
    -   The residual deviance is **43,105** on **7,029 degrees of freedom**.
    -   This ratio (Degrees of Freedom/ Residual Deviance) is approximately **6.13**, which is significantly greater than 1. This indicates **overdispersion** (variance \> mean), suggesting the Poisson model may not be a perfect fit.

**2. Significant Predictors:**

-   Predictors with extremely low p-values (p\<0.001p \< 0.001p\<0.001) include:
    -   **Contract type** (One-year and Two-year contracts)
    -   **Internet Service** (Fiber optic and No Internet Service)
    -   **Payment Method** (Mailed check and Credit card)
    -   **Senior Citizen**, **Partner**, **Monthly Charges**, and **Total Charges**
-   Non-significant predictors:
    -   **StreamingTV** and **StreamingMovies** were not significant, indicating they may not have a strong impact on tenure.

**3. Overdispersion Check:**

-   Overdispersion occurs when the variance of the response variable is greater than the mean.
    -   **Mean of Tenure**: \~32 months
    -   **Variance of Tenure**: Much larger than the mean, indicating overdispersion.
    -   This can be addressed by using:
        -   **Quasi-Poisson Regression**: Allows for overdispersion by adjusting the standard errors.

## Visualization.

**Boxplot for Contract**

```{r Poisson-Visualizations, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Boxplot for Contract
ggplot(d.cleaned_telecom_customer_churn, aes(x = Contract, y = tenure)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", outlier.color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Tenure vs Contract Type", x = "Contract Type", y = "Tenure (Months)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

-   **Month-to-month contracts** show the shortest median tenure, with many outliers indicating customers leaving quickly.
-   **One-year** and **Two-year contracts** significantly increase tenure, with Two-year contracts having the longest median tenure.

Boxplot for Internet Service

```{r Poisson-Visualizations2, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Boxplot for Internet Service
ggplot(d.cleaned_telecom_customer_churn, aes(x = InternetService, y = tenure)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightgreen", outlier.color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Tenure vs Internet Service", x = "Internet Service Type", y = "Tenure (Months)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

-   Customers with **No internet service** tend to have shorter tenures.
-   **DSL** and **Fiber optic** services show similar median tenures, indicating these internet options retain customers for similar durations

Model with Quasi- Poisson Model with interaction Terms:

```{r Poisson-QuasiModel, echo=FALSE, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
glm_quasi <- glm(tenure ~ InternetService * Contract + PaymentMethod * Contract +
                   StreamingTV + StreamingMovies + SeniorCitizen + Partner +
                   MonthlyCharges + TotalCharges,
                 family = quasipoisson(link = "log"),
                 data = d.cleaned_telecom_customer_churn)
summary(glm_quasi)
```

**Model Performance**

1.  Dispersion Parameter:
    -   The dispersion parameter for the quasi-Poisson model is **3.99**, confirming overdispersion (variance \> mean).
    -   This indicates that the quasi-Poisson model is better suited for this dataset compared to the Poisson model.
2.  Residual Deviance:
    -   **Residual Deviance**: 31,910 (on 7,019 degrees of freedom), consistent with the Poisson model.
    -   This shows that the fit remains the same, but the quasi-Poisson model adjusts the standard errors for overdispersion, leading to more reliable p-values.

**Insights**

1.  Interaction Terms are Significant:
    -   Significant interaction effects for **Internet Service x Contract** and **Payment Method x Contract** highlight the importance of combining these factors to predict tenure effectively.
2.  Adjusted Standard Errors:
    -   Quasi-Poisson correction adjusts the standard errors, resulting in more reliable significance levels compared to the Poisson model.
3.  Non-Significant Predictors:
    -   **Streaming Services** and **Credit card (automatic)** are not significant, suggesting they may not strongly impact tenure.

### Business Insights and Recommendations

1.  **Encourage Long-Term Contracts**:
    -   Promote One-year and Two-year contracts, particularly for customers with **No Internet Service**, to boost retention.
2.  **Optimize Internet Service Offerings**:
    -   Address potential dissatisfaction among **Fiber optic** customers by enhancing service quality or offering competitive pricing.
    -   Bundling internet services with contracts can significantly improve tenure.
3.  **Reevaluate Payment Methods**:
    -   Reduce reliance on **Mailed checks**, as they correlate with shorter tenure.
    -   Incentivize automatic payments to retain customers longer.
4.  **Pricing Sensitivity**:
    -   Monitor **Monthly Charges** closely and consider pricing strategies or discounts to improve retention among price-sensitive customers.

Customer **tenure** is strongly influenced by contract type, internet service, and payment methods, with significant interaction effects between these factors. Long-term contracts and bundled internet services emerge as the most effective strategies to enhance customer retention.

data$InternetService <- as.factor(data$InternetService)

#str(data)
#colSums(is.na(data))
```

Let's plot some results to understand the data better.

## Plot: Tenure vs. TotalCharges by Churn

```{r}
# Ensure necessary libraries are installed
if(!require(ggplot2)) install.packages("ggplot2")

# Load the library
library(ggplot2)


ggplot(data, aes(x = tenure, y = TotalCharges, color = Churn)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Tenure and Total Charges by Churn",
    x = "Tenure (Months)",
    y = "Total Charges"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "red"), labels = c("No Churn", "Churn")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Higher tenure and total charges are associated with lower churn, reinforcing loyalty among long-term customers with higher spending.

## Plot: Tenure by Contract Type

```{r}

ggplot(data, aes(x = Contract, y = tenure, fill = Contract)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Tenure by Contract Type",
    x = "Contract Type",
    y = "Tenure (Months)"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "orange", "purple")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Longer contract durations (e.g., two years) correlate with higher customer retention, likely due to lower churn incentives.

## Plot: Churn by Payment Method

```{r}

ggplot(data, aes(x = PaymentMethod, fill = Churn)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of Churn by Payment Method",
    x = "Payment Method",
    y = "Proportion"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "red"), labels = c("No Churn", "Churn")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()
```

Customers using electronic checks exhibit the highest churn proportion, suggesting potential dissatisfaction or difficulties with this payment method.

## Plot: Churn Proportion by Internet Service

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
if (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages("ggplot2")
if (!require(dplyr)) install.packages("dplyr")

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Create a dataset for proportions and counts
proportion_df <- data %>%
  group_by(InternetService, Churn) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  mutate(Total = sum(Count),
         Proportion = Count / Total)

# Plot the bar chart with counts displayed
ggplot(proportion_df, aes(x = InternetService, y = Proportion, fill = as.factor(Churn))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Count), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), vjust = -0.2, size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of Churn by Internet Service with Counts",
    x = "Internet Service Type",
    y = "Proportion",
    fill = "Churn"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "red"), labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Fiber optic users have significantly higher churn rates than DSL or users without internet service, indicating dissatisfaction with fiber optic services.

Let's create models of GLM and GAM to see if they catch these relations and how will they perform compared to each other.

## GLM

```{r}

# Set 'No service' as the reference level for InternetService
data$InternetService <- relevel(data$InternetService, ref = "No")
# Confirm reference level
cat("Reference level for 'Contract':", levels(data$Contract)[1], "\n")
cat("Reference level for 'InternetService':", levels(data$InternetService)[1], "\n")
# Fit the GLM with interaction terms
glm_model_interaction <- glm(Churn ~ SeniorCitizen + Contract + PaymentMethod + 
                             tenure + TotalCharges + 
                             InternetService + OnlineSecurity + TechSupport + 
                             PaperlessBilling + MultipleLines, 
                             family = binomial, data = data)
# Check the summary
summary(glm_model_interaction)

```

So let's interpret the results:

Fiber optic users are more likely to churn, while DSL users are less likely to churn compared to no internet service customers.

Electronic check users are at higher risk of churn.

Customers with higher tenure and total charges are less likely to churn.

Longer contracts significantly reduce churn risk.

Senior citizens are more likely to churn

Electronic check users are more likely to churn.

Online security increases churn

Tech support significantly increases churn risk.

Longer contracts significantly reduce churn.

## Did the model overfit?

```{r}
library(pROC)
# Split data into training and test sets
set.seed(123)
train_indices <- sample(1:nrow(data), 0.7 * nrow(data))
train_data <- data[train_indices, ]
test_data <- data[-train_indices, ]

# Predict on training and test data
train_preds <- predict(glm_model_interaction, train_data, type = "response")
test_preds <- predict(glm_model_interaction, test_data, type = "response")

# Calculate performance metrics
library(pROC)
train_auc <- roc(train_data$Churn, train_preds)$auc
test_auc <- roc(test_data$Churn, test_preds)$auc

cat("Train AUC:", train_auc, "\n")
cat("Test AUC:", test_auc, "\n")
```

The Train AUC (0.847) and Test AUC (0.854) are very close, indicating that the model performs consistently on both the training and test datasets. This suggests good generalization without overfitting to the training data.

```{r}
library(caret)

# Set up cross-validation
control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10) # 10-fold cross-validation

# Train the model
cv_model <- caret::train(Churn ~ SeniorCitizen + Contract + PaymentMethod + 
                  tenure + MonthlyCharges + TotalCharges + 
                  InternetService + InternetService:MonthlyCharges, 
                  data = data, method = "glm", family = "binomial", trControl = control)

# Check cross-validation results
print(cv_model)
```

If there were significant overfitting, we would expect a much larger difference between training and cross-validation accuracy. So it seems there is no overfit

## GAM WITH NON-LINEAR PATTERNS

```{r}
library(mgcv)
data$TotalCharges_centered <- data$TotalCharges- mean(data$TotalCharges)
cat("Reference level for 'Contract':", levels(data$Contract)[1], "\n")
cat("Reference level for 'InternetService':", levels(data$InternetService)[1], "\n")
gam_smoothing_spline <- gam(Churn ~ SeniorCitizen + Contract + PaymentMethod + 
                             s(tenure) + s(TotalCharges_centered) + 
                             InternetService + OnlineSecurity + TechSupport + 
                             PaperlessBilling + MultipleLines, 
                             family = binomial, data = data, select=TRUE)
summary(gam_smoothing_spline)
```

edf shows that mooth terms for tenure and TotalCharges_centered are highly significant (p \< 0.001), indicating non-linear effects. Relationship is non-linear but not overly complex.

## ROC COMPARISON

Let's compare these models.

```{r}

library(pROC)

# Predictions for glm_model
pred1 <- predict(glm_model_interaction, type = "response")
roc1 <- roc(data$Churn, pred1)

pred2 <- predict(gam_smoothing_spline, type = "response")
roc2 <- roc(data$Churn, pred2)

# Plot ROC curves
plot(roc1, col = "blue", lwd = 2, main = "ROC Curve Comparison")
lines(roc2, col = "red", lwd = 2)
legend("bottomright", legend = c("glm_model_interaction", "gam_smoothing_spline"),
       col = c("blue", "red"), lwd = 2)

auc1 <- auc(roc1)
auc2 <- auc(roc2)
cat("AUC of Model glm_model_interaction:", auc1, "\n")
cat("AUC of Model gam_smoothing_spline:", auc2, "\n")
```

Both models perform similarly in terms of AUC, but GAM slightly edges out GLM in predictive performance.

```{r}
anova(glm_model_interaction, gam_smoothing_spline, test = "Chisq")
```

GAM explains more variance than GLM.

```{r}
AIC(glm_model_interaction, gam_smoothing_spline)
```

GAM has a slightly lower AIC (5809.896) than GLM (5828.536), further supporting that GAM provides a better fit to the data.

## Conclusion

Both models performed well in predicting churn, with GAM offering additional flexibility to capture non-linear relationships. While the non-linearity in some variables, like tenure, was not significant, GAM successfully identified a meaningful non-linear relationship with TotalCharges. The results highlight that customers are more likely to churn if they use fiber optic internet, pay via electronic checks, lack online security or tech support, or are senior citizens. Conversely, churn risk is lower for DSL users, those with higher tenure and total charges, and customers on longer-term contracts

# Neural Network (NN) (Kenny)

    -   Balances customer identification (high sensitivity) with resource management (moderate specificity).
2.  **Simpler Options**:
    -   **Size = 1, Decay = 0.04** is a lightweight model for quicker predictions while maintaining strong accuracy.
3.  **Focused Trade-offs**:
    -   **Size = 7, Decay = 0.04** provides higher specificity for targeted retention campaigns.
    -   Suitable for businesses with resource constraints aiming to minimize false positives.

## Churn Probability Prediction

Using the trained SVM model, churn probabilities were calculated for each customer.

**Steps**:

1. The SVM model was tuned using radial kernel with the best parameters: `Cost = 10`, `Gamma = 0.1`.
2. Predictions were generated, including probabilities for both classes (`Yes` for churn, `No` for non-churn).

```{r SVM-ChurnProbabilityPrediction, echo=FALSE, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(e1071)
library(caret)
library(ggplot2)
library(pROC)
library(dplyr)

# Load the cleaned dataset
data <- read_csv(
  file.path(cleaned_data_dir, "telecom_customers_churn_cleaned.csv")
)

# Check for missing values
sum(is.na(data))

# Convert target variable to a factor
data$Churn <- as.factor(data$Churn)

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(data$Churn, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
trainData <- data[trainIndex, ]
testData <- data[-trainIndex, ]

# Train the SVM model
svm_model <- svm(Churn ~ ., data = trainData, kernel = "radial", cost = 1, 
                 gamma = 0.1)

# Make predictions on the test data
predictions <- predict(svm_model, testData)

# Evaluate the model
confusionMatrix(predictions, testData$Churn)

# Tune the SVM model for optimal hyperparameters
set.seed(123)
tuned_parameters <- tune(svm, Churn ~ ., data = trainData,
                         ranges = list(cost = 10, 
                                       gamma = 0.1),
                         probability = TRUE)

# Best model
best_model <- tuned_parameters$best.model

# Make predictions with the best model
best_predictions <- predict(best_model, testData)

# Evaluate the best model
confusionMatrix(best_predictions, testData$Churn)

# Check the best parameters chosen during tuning
best_parameters <- tuned_parameters$best.parameters
print(best_parameters)
```

## Evaluate additional metrics for the tuned model

```{r SVM-AdditionalMetrics, echo=FALSE, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Ensure the predicted and actual values are factors
best_predictions <- as.factor(best_predictions)
testData$Churn <- as.factor(testData$Churn)

# Generate the confusion matrix using caret explicitly
conf_matrix <- caret::confusionMatrix(data = best_predictions,
                                      reference = testData$Churn)

# Extract Accuracy
accuracy <- conf_matrix$overall["Accuracy"]
cat("Accuracy:", accuracy, "\n")

# Extract Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
precision <- conf_matrix$byClass["Pos Pred Value"]
recall <- conf_matrix$byClass["Sensitivity"]
f1_score <- 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)

cat("Precision:", precision, "\n")
cat("Recall:", recall, "\n")
cat("F1-Score:", f1_score, "\n")

# ---Generate the ROC curve and calculate AUC---
# Get decision values (raw scores) for predictions
svm_decision_values <- predict(best_model, testData, decision.values = TRUE)

# Extract decision values for the ROC curve
decision_values <- as.numeric(attr(svm_decision_values, "decision.values"))

# Recalculate the ROC curve
roc_curve <- roc(response = testData$Churn,
                 predictor = decision_values,
                 levels = rev(levels(testData$Churn)))

# Plot the corrected ROC curve
plot(roc_curve, col = "blue", main = "Corrected ROC Curve for Tuned SVM Model", lwd = 2)
auc_value <- auc(roc_curve)
cat("Corrected AUC:", auc_value, "\n")
```

## Churn Probability Prediction

Using the trained SVM model, churn probabilities were calculated for each customer.

**Steps**:

1. The SVM model was tuned using radial kernel with the best parameters: `Cost = 10`, `Gamma = 0.1`.
2. Predictions were generated, including probabilities for both classes (`Yes` for churn, `No` for non-churn).

**Sample Output**:

```{r SVM-ChurnProbabilityPredictionOutput, echo=FALSE, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Train the SVM model with probability estimates enabled
svm_model <- svm(Churn ~ ., data = trainData, kernel = "radial", 
                 cost = 1, gamma = 0.1, probability = TRUE)

# run with best parameters cost 10 and gamma 0.1 instead of tuning it again
tuned_parameters <- tune(svm, Churn ~ ., data = trainData,
                         ranges = list(cost = 10, 
                                       gamma = 0.1),
                         probability = TRUE)

# Best model with probabilities
best_model <- tuned_parameters$best.model


# Check the best parameters chosen during tuning
best_parameters <- tuned_parameters$best.parameters
print(best_parameters)


# Predict churn probabilities using the best model
probabilities <- predict(best_model, testData, probability = TRUE)

# Extract probabilities
probabilities_df <- attr(probabilities, "probabilities")
head(probabilities_df)  # View predicted probabilities for both classes
```



## Customer Segmentation Based on Churn Risk

Customers were segmented into three risk groups based on churn probabilities:

| **Risk Group** | **Churn Probability Range** | **Count** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Low Risk** | `< 0.3` | 1,034 |
| **Medium Risk** | `0.3 - 0.7` | 228 |
| **High Risk** | `> 0.7` | 145 |

```{r SVM-CustomerSegmentation, echo=FALSE, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Add churn probabilities and predicted class to the test data
testData$Churn_Prob <- probabilities_df[, "Yes"]
testData$Risk_Group <- cut(testData$Churn_Prob, 
                           breaks = c(0, 0.3, 0.7, 1),
                           labels = c("Low Risk", "Medium Risk", "High Risk"))

# View segmented data
head(testData[, c("Churn_Prob", "Risk_Group")])
```



**Insights**:

- **Low Risk**: Loyal customers with longer tenure and lower churn probability.
- **Medium Risk**: A transitional group that requires targeted retention efforts to prevent escalation to high risk.
- **High Risk**: Customers with the shortest tenure and highest churn probability, requiring immediate attention.

**Visualization**:

```{r SVM-VisualizingCustomerSegmentation, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Plot churn probability by risk group
ggplot(testData, aes(x = Risk_Group, y = Churn_Prob)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Risk_Group)) +
  ggtitle("Customer Segmentation by Churn Risk") +
  xlab("Risk Group") +
  ylab("Churn Probability") +
  theme_minimal()
```

A **boxplot** was used to visualize the distribution of churn probabilities across risk groups, highlighting distinct differences.


## Key Feature Insights

**Average Monthly Charges and Tenure by Risk Group**:

```{r SVM-FeatureImportance, echo=FALSE, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# ---Grouping Customers by Key Features---
# Summarize average monthly charges by risk group
segmentation_summary <- testData %>%
  group_by(Risk_Group) %>%
  summarise(
    Avg_MonthlyCharges = mean(MonthlyCharges),
    Avg_Tenure = mean(tenure),
    Count = n()
  )

print(segmentation_summary)

```

**Observations**:

- **High Risk** customers have the highest monthly charges and shortest tenure.
- **Low Risk** customers pay less on average but stay significantly longer.

**Actionable Steps**:

1. **High-Risk Customers**:
    - Offer discounts or loyalty incentives to reduce churn.
    - Focus on engagement strategies during the early months of the customer lifecycle.
2. **Medium-Risk Customers**:
    - Deploy retention campaigns, such as satisfaction surveys or targeted offers, to prevent escalation to high risk.
3. **Low-Risk Customers**:
    - Reward loyalty with perks, such as exclusive deals or access to premium services.
    
## Customer Retention Strategy

1. **Segment-Based Interventions**:
    - Customize strategies for each risk group.
2. **High-Risk Customers**:
    - Deploy immediate retention efforts, such as discounts or personalized outreach.
3. **Medium-Risk Customers**:
    - Monitor and engage proactively to prevent churn escalation.
4. **Low-Risk Customers**:
    - Continue engagement to maintain loyalty.

The SVM model provides robust predictions with high recall and precision, making it well-suited for customer churn analysis. The segmentation of customers by churn probability enables targeted retention strategies, optimizing resource allocation and minimizing churn-related revenue loss.
